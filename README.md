# DEVWKS1700 - Cisco Live Melbourne 2024

This repository is a partial fork of Alex Stevensons repository [intro-ansible-automation](https://github.com/xanderstevenson/intro-ansible-automation) and is used for the DEVWKS1700 session at Cisco Live Melbourne 2024.

The code has been modified from the original repository to make it more portable across different systems and users through the use of local path references, rather than absolutes.

A PDF copy of the slides will be available at a later date (TBD, but before the conclusion of the final run of this workshop in Melbourne).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or later (untested on earlier versions)
- Virtual environment with appropriate packages (see [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) for packages and versions)

All commands to be run are also listed in the [commands.txt](./commands.txt) file.
